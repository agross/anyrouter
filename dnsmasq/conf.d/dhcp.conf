# Set the DHCP server to authoritative mode. In this mode it will barge in
# and take over the lease for any client which broadcasts on the network,
# whether it has a record of the lease or not. This avoids long timeouts
# when a machine wakes up on a new network. DO NOT enable this if there's
# the slightest chance that you might end up accidentally configuring a DHCP
# server for your campus/company accidentally. The ISC server uses
# the same option, and this URL provides more information:

# Enable DHCPv4 Rapid Commit Option specified in RFC 4039. When enabled,

# option with a DHCPACK including a Rapid Commit option and fully committed
# address and configuration information.

# Uncomment this to enable the integrated DHCP server, you need

# service.
